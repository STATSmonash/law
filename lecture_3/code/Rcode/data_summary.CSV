"The first three rows are sample size, mean and standard deviation.  Skewness and kurtosis are relative to a normal distribution (which has skewness 0 and kurtosis 3).  JarqBera is a JB test statistic (a weighted average of kurtosis and skewness) used to assess normality.  The p-values for skewness, kurtosis and JB are for tests of normality (low values are evidence against normality).  The autocor(ac1) row is the first lag autocorrelation and is followed by p-values for testing the null hypothesis of zero autocorrelation (based on the Ljung-Box Q-test for one and then up to number of lags shown).  The minimum, maximum and quantile (q.) statistics follow in the remaining rows."
